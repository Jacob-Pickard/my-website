As of 2/26 I do not have any sort of feedback so I'll make a few changes to my website that I realized after the previous unit.

Firstly, there was an annoyingly large margin around the icons so I simply set a left margin to space it slightly away from the text.

Next, I remembered that any underlining on a website usually represents a link so I removed an emphasis tag on my index page and replaced it with an i tag for italics. 
My previous margin change on the i tag did impact this though so I added a new class for italics specifically so there was not an abnormally large gap in my text.
In addition, I also added various formatting changes to lay out the text in a more visually pleasing way.

Additionally, I'll go over some of the respones left on my module 7 assignment.
-Make your text smaller at smaller screen widths
Added a few media queries for this.
-I find black on dark gray a little hard to read. Consider a light gray for header text?
Tried a light gray but it clashes with the gray on the left side of website's gradient and makes it hard to read. Though black is definitely a problem on some pages.
Adjusted the darkness of the gradient which causes the readability issues with black headers.
-Include more comments in CSS or seperate it into multiple files.
Added several comments on the purposes of some style rules, as well as shuffling things to categories where they are used.


3/4:
Some of the critques of my website that I've received now are as follows:
- In the “What is there to do?” section of the main page, I like that there is a link for Shiny Hunting to ease navigation, but I think there could also be one for the Global Trade Link page.
Added links to each page from the home page, outside of the nav bar.
- The Teams page has no visual elements
Working on getting an image of the team hanging out together. Team is relatively new so we haven't actually taken a picture yet. This will be added soon. For now I have added a temporary image of my old team.
- I realize that the descriptions were tied to the images above it instead, suggestion: adjust the proximity or find a way to visually tie the text to the image (like a border around the image and accompanying text)
Adjusted the shinies page by adding more information as well as implementing the requested border around related information.

3/11:
Some more peer reviews of my website:
- the contrast between the text and the background could be improved to make the text pop more.
Not sure exactly how I could address this, ive explored making the the fonts different colors, changing the background gradient, just could never find something that I liked that fit.
- visibility of the icons next to the navigation options could be enhanced
I believe that these icons are already perfectly sized, any larger and it creates issues with the nav bar
- the only thing i would say to add on is the reason why people should play (hint AI is good at that).
A very great suggestion, but it is already a feature of the website.
