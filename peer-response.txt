As of 2/26 I do not have any sort of feedback so I'll make a few changes to my website that I realized after the previous unit.

Firstly, there was an annoyingly large margin around the icons so I simply set a left margin to space it slightly away from the text.

Next, I remembered that any underlining on a website usually represents a link so I removed an emphasis tag on my index page and replaced it with an i tag for italics. 
My previous margin change on the i tag did impact this though so I added a new class for italics specifically so there was not an abnormally large gap in my text.
In addition, I also added various formatting changes to lay out the text in a more visually pleasing way.

Additionally, I'll go over some of the respones left on my module 7 assignment.
-Make your text smaller at smaller screen widths
Added a few media queries for this.
-I find black on dark gray a little hard to read. Consider a light gray for header text?
Tried a light gray but it clashes with the gray on the left side of website's gradient and makes it hard to read. Though black is definitely a problem on some pages.
Adjusted the darkness of the gradient which causes the readability issues with black headers.
-Include more comments in CSS or seperate it into multiple files.
Added several comments on the purposes of some style rules, as well as shuffling things to categories where they are used.
