    <h1>About Teams in PokeMMO</h1>
    <p>Teams in PokeMMO are are unique way to interact with and be involved in the community. A team is similar to a
        club or what other games refer to as a "Clan". It is simply a social group of people with similar interest in a
        game. Generally, the teams in PokeMMO are
        focused on one sort of goal. For example, most teams in PokeMMO relate to shiny hunting. But there are also
        teams that focus on PvP (Player vs Player).</p>
    <p>Some benefits of a team include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A unique social experience where you all share a similar interest and passion for a game.</li>
        <li>General help with the game, members will often help you with an questions that you have.</li>
        <li>Team events, such as shiny races/wars, catch events, raffles, secret santa, etc. </li>
        <li>Members will often share 3 link spots on shiny charms, which increase your likelihood of finding a shiny.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>About my Team</h3>
    <p>The Team that I am currently in is a relatively new team referred to as Team Radiance. Currently, the team is
        very small in size with just about 45 members, but it is still fun to be a part of. For example, when you log
        back in you are often greeted to a welcome back by your teammates, which really creates a sense of community and
        belonging. In addition, we often have events with in-game money rewards which is a nice bonus to being part of a
        big group of friends.</p>
