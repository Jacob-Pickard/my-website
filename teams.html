    <h1>About Teams in PokeMMO<i class="fa-solid fa-people-group"></i></h1>
    <p>Teams in PokeMMO are are unique way to interact with and be involved in the community. A team is similar to a
        club or what other games refer to as a "Clan". It is simply a social group of people with similar interest in a
        game. Generally, the teams in PokeMMO are
        focused on one sort of goal. For example, most teams in PokeMMO relate to shiny hunting. But there are also
        teams that focus on PvP (Player vs Player).</p>
    <p>Some benefits of a team include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A unique social experience where you all share a similar interest and passion for a game.</li>
        <li>General help with the game, members will often help you with an questions that you have.</li>
        <li>Team events, such as shiny races/wars, catch events, raffles, secret santa, etc. </li>
        <li>Members will often share 3 link spots on shiny charms, which increase your likelihood of finding a shiny.
        </li>
    </ul>

            <h3>About my Team</h3>
            <p>The Team that I am currently in is a relatively new team referred to as Team Radiance. Currently, the
                team is
                very small in size with just about 50 members, but it is still fun to be a part of. For example, when
                you log
                back in you are often greeted to a welcome back by your teammates, which really creates a sense of
                community and
                belonging. In addition, we often have events with in-game money rewards which is a nice bonus to being
                part of a
                big group of friends.</p>
            <p>Being part of a team is one of the most enjoyable aspects of PokeMMO as it really creates a sense of
                community. Going from solo play to being in a team changes the game for me in such a drastic way, as it
                becomes a social game on top of the amazing game it already is.</p>
