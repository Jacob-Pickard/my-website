    <h1>About the GTL (Global Trade Link)</h1>
    <p>The Global Trade Link is hugely important feature to PokeMMO's gameplay. It facilitates the buying and selling of
        almost any item in PokeMMO, and is hugely important to every persons experience with the game. </p>
    <p>This is because it is used to sell and purchase things such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pokemon</li>
        <li>Items</li>
        <li>Shiny hunting supplies</li>
        <li>Vanities (Cosmetic Items)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The GTL is hugely important in generating money for any account, because you will need various pokemon and items
        throughout
        your adventure. And sourcing them yourself is not always very convenient. This creates demand for many
        pokemon or items that are useful.</p>

            <h3>How to use the GTL</h3>
            <p>The GTL is luckily very intuitive to use, it displays the pokemon and other information associated with
                it
                such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The type of Pokemon</li>
                <li>The gender of the Pokemon</li>
                <li>The nature of the Pokemon</li>
                <li>The IVs (Individual Values) and stats of the Pokemon</li>
                <li>The price of the Pokemon</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is even more simplified on the Items section of the GTL as there is much less information associated
                with items.</p>
