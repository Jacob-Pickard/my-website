        <p>PokeMMO is a massively mulitplayer online game that contains all pokemon games generation 1-5, and allows you
            to
            switch between them at will.</p>

            <h2>Why play PokeMMO?</h2>
            <p>PokeMMO has one of the nicest and most helpful communities out of any game I've ever played. Not to
                mention
                the nostalgia from playing all the classic pokemon games! The game also includes a unique global market,
                which allows trade between players.</p> <!--maybe make this a UL?-->

            <h2>What is there to do in PokeMMO?</h2>
            <p>PokeMMO has a wide selection of activities to complete.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can complete the story of the five games</li>
                <li>Catch and sell pokemon to make money</li>
                <li>Join a team of fellow players</li>
                <li>Shiny Hunting of course! Though in this game, the base shiny odds are
                    <strong><em>1/30,000</em></strong> making this much more of a challenge.
